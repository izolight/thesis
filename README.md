# Trustworth Remote Signing

Accessible Electronic Signatures for Everyone
------------

In this thesis, we propose a way to reduce the trust required when outsourcing electronic signatures to
third party services. We compare our proposal to an existing standard by the Adobe-led Cloud
Signature Consortium, and we implement it in a proof-of-concept.

This repository contains all documents for thesis as well as the sourcecode for the protocol and implementations.
The final thesis is at doc/thesis.pdf
